<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project :brain:

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
I am tired of browsing through my <b>saved reels or youtube video</b> for grappling content. So, why not create my own tracking libraries for me to keep track of my grappling progress? ü§î<br>
<br>
So, that is my sole inspiration. Project is still <b>on-going with several road blocks and fixing terrible planning</b> <br>
<br>
p.s: its my first major CRUD project with login authorization. Please be kind ü•∫ <br>

<br>
If you find this helpful or can resonate with that kind of struggle as a fellow grappler/coder and would love to contribute or work with it and feel free to do so! (maybe a star too ‚≠ê)
