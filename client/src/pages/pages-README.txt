Main backbone of the applications:
Home.js - This page serves as the landing page of your application. It could feature a welcome message, highlight key features of the app, and maybe showcase some popular or recent Jiu-Jitsu techniques.

TechniquesList.js - A page dedicated to listing all the Jiu-Jitsu techniques available in your database. This page could include filtering and sorting capabilities to help users easily find the techniques they're interested in.

TechniqueDetail.js - When a user clicks on a technique from the list, they can be taken to this page to see detailed information about it. This could include a description, instructional videos or images, and comments or tips from other users.

SubmitTechnique.js - A page where registered users can submit new techniques to the app. This would include a form where users can enter details about the technique, such as its name, description, and any relevant images or videos.

Login.js - If your app requires users to log in (for submitting techniques or accessing personalized content), this page would contain the login form.

Register.js - Similar to the LoginPage but for new users to create an account.

About.js - A page that provides more information about your app, its purpose, the team behind it, and maybe some contact information.

UserProfile.js (Optional) - If your app supports user profiles, this page could display user information, their submitted techniques, and any other personalized content or settings.

NotFound.js - A generic page to display when a user navigates to a route that does not exist in your application. It's good practice to have a user-friendly page that guides them back to the main content.
